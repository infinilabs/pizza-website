Each CPU core and associated threads operate independently, without sharing memory or resources with other cores or nodes. Additionally, Pizza embraces a fully asynchronous manner to access I/O and network resources, leveraging technologies like io_uring for efficient I/O operations.</description></item><item><title>Why named Pizza</title><link>/docs/overview/sharding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/overview/sharding/</guid><description>Why named Pizza? # Do you wonder why this project is named Pizza?

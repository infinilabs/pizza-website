A search consists of one or more queries that are combined and sent to Pizza. Documents that match a search&amp;rsquo;s queries are returned in the hits, or search results, of the response.
A search may also contain additional information used to better process its queries. For example, a search may be limited to a specific collection or only return a specific number of results.</description></item></channel></rss>
